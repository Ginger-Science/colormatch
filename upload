ðŸ“¸ This portal collects public images of redheads to build a phenotype reference dataset for scientific and community use. Please only upload photos youâ€™ve taken yourself, and only when you have consentâ€”or the image was taken in a public space where no expectation of privacy applies.

By uploading, you agree:
- You own or have the right to share this image.
- You are not submitting medical or private health data.
- This image may be displayed publicly, analyzed for visible traits (hair shade, freckles, eye color), and contribute to redhead-focused scientific projects.

Please respect others' privacy and dignity. No harassment, explicit content, or non-consensual uploads. Let's keep this community smart, safe, and curious.
